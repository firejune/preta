What is Preta?
-----

Transifex is a modern localization platform.

It's an online, cloud-based, highly scalable translation management and
workflow tool, with a focus to integrate well with the existing workflow of
agile development teams and translators.

The name comes from latin and means 'Translation artisan'.

Key features:

- Workflow Management: Full control over your localization process. Great
  integrations with your own systems and workflow using our client app,
  libraries and a rich API.

- Continuous Localization: An online internationalization tool which adapts
  to the production cycle of fast-paced teams with dynamic content and agile
  releases.

- Coordinated Collaboration: Create self-managed language teams under your
  project. Invite 10 professional or 10.000 volunteer translators. Or both.

- Quality Control: Translation Memory, glossary, proofreading, translation
  suggestions with voting. All the tools you'll ever need to ensure high quality.
